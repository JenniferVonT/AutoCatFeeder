# Automatic Cat Feeder
**Author:** Jennifer von Trotta-Treyden (jv222th)

## Project overview
This project will create a prototype for an automatic cat feeder that dispenses food when the bowl is getting low (My cat is free fed meaning she always has kibble out). It would be simple to change it to instead dispense during certain times and fill the bowl to a certain weight instead of trying to keep the bowl consistently full aswell. The project uses an IoT device with both sensors and acutators, using the built in WiFi capabilities of the Raspberry Pi Pico W to send notifications through the Telegram API if there is an error in dispensing the food or if the container is running low, it also sends data to an AdaFruti IO server feed for data visualization. The build of the frame/casing consists of plexiglass, cut and built by hand, the innerbox and construction is made using a plastic container that has been altered to work for the project.

Estimated time to make the project could be anywhere between **6-24+** hours, a lot depends on how you choose to build the boxes/construction, the thing that took me the longest was to cut the plexiglass into pieces because of lack of proper tools for it and build the box and the second longest was debugging the HX711 and load cell setup.

**Code Language:** MicroPython

## Objective
I chose this project because I have an indoor cat and she is free fed (meaning she always has dry food out). I was contemplating different projects I could use surrounding my cat and knew I wanted to do something for her that would also make something easier for me, an auto feeder ended up being the most fitting project for that, that also both include sensors and acutators. It will make it easier to make sure that there is always food in the bowl both when you are away during the day but also if the food runs out in the middle of the night. It will also send notifications to my cellphone when the food is running low in the dispenser container so that I don't always have to check all the time if it needs refilling, the container has the capacity for approximately 4-5 full bowls which means I will not have to refill for around 4-5 days since my cat eats around a bowl a day.

I wanted to include both sensors and acutators to this project, since I was pretty new to IoT and the hardware aspect in general I wanted to challenge myself a bit on that front and learn more about it. I have a bit of knowledge about programming (mostly javascript/java though) so the hurdle there was just to get used to a new language (MicroPython).

## Material
Since I was pretty new with hardware I took a safe route and built everything on a breadboard, it made it easier to experiment and move the cables around but will in the end not be as securely attached as if it was soldered together instead. All of my material is bought from electrokit or my local store, but I will link the specific component in the table below.
There is one (1) of each component except the cables.

## Computer Setup
### IDE
- Visual Studio Code (VSC) [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

### Extensions and extras
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (required to make PyMakr work)
- PyMakr:
  - In VSC open the extensions tab on the left.
  - Write in "Pymakr" in the search bar.
  - Select the "Pymakr" by Pycom.
  - Click install.

- Create a new project in PyMakr:
  - Select the "PyMakr" tab on the left.
  - Create a new project by clickin the + sign on the **"PROJECTS"** tab.
  - Select where to save the project.
  - Write the name of the project folder.
  - Confirm the project folder.
  - Add device port by selecting **"Communications port (COM1) / Unkown"** <br><br>
    This should have created a folder in your **Explorer** tab where three files are automatically created, boot.py, main.py and pymakr.conf (In the pymakr.conf file you can decide the name of the project, that the name that will be shown in the PyMakr tab)

### Configure the Raspberry Pi Pico WH
  - Hold down the **BOOTSEL** button while connecting the Pico to the computer using the usb cable.
  - Download and insert the most recent firmware [HERE](https://micropython.org/download/RPI_PICO_W/) into the explorer file that automatically opens up.
